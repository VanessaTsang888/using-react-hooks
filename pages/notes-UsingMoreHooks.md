We can use hooks to declaratively create functionality. Before hooks we had to use React Class component do do what we can now do in functional components very simply.

Before hooks, I would of needed to create a class constructor to initialise my state. I would of have to do some complex programming around calling getState and setState, instead of using a simple React hook that returns a variable and a setter for that variable.

Using Class components to manage my states is old school. Most developers today have upgraded to Functional components so they can use Hooks.
No need to rewrite Class components to Functional components as not much difference in performance. Use React Hooks to write any new components as its better programming paradignm.
