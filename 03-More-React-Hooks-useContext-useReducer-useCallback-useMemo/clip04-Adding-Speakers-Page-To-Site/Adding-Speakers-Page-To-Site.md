MY NOTES FROM LECTURE: Adding-Speakers-Page-To-Site:
Building out the Conference Speakers Page with Our Primitive React Hooks:
useState, useRef, useEffect.

Code our Speakers page using the three primitive Hooks: useState, useRef and useEffect.

App.js -> import the Speakers component, create that component.

Create component: SpeakerDetail.js ->
since we want to use our ImageToggleOnScroll component so that our speaker images are in color when they are in view, import that component.

Now complete using the primitive hooks. Browsing the app on the FE/UI:
I've tested the Speakers page by I can see I have all the speakers rendered with scrolling doing the appropriate colorisations.
